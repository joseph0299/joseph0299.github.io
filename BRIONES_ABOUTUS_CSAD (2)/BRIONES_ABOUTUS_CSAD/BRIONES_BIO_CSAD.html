	<blockquote><p><sup>(1)</sup>During my childhood years I always want to play some street games with my friends and cousins, we always play games like patentero, hide and seek, <sup>(2)</sup>tumbang preso, luksong baka, and many more,
	 I think because it is the nature to a child, they always seek for happiness. Furthermore, sometimes our <sup>(3)</sup>family will go to farm to visit our ricefield and 
	 to take rest have a relaxing air. Childhood is the most fun and memorable time in anyone’s life. It’s the first <sup>(4)</sup>stage of life which we enjoy in whatever way we like. 
	 Besides, this is the time that shapes up the future. The parents love and care for their children and <sup>(5)</sup>the children to the same too. Moreover, it’s the golden period of life in which we can teach children everything.
	 The memories of childhood ultimately <sup>(6)</sup>become the life long memory which always brings a smile on our faces. Only the grownups know the real value of childhood because the children do not <sup>(7)</sup>understand these things. 
     Moreover, Children’s have no worries, no stress, and they are free from the filth of worldly life. Also, when an individual collects <sup>(8)</sup>memories of his/her childhood they give a delighted feeling.
     Besides, bad memories haunt the person his entire life. Apart from this, as we grow we feel <sup>(9)</sup>more attachment to our childhood and we want to get back those days but we can’t. That’s why many people say ‘time is neither a 
     friend nor a foe’. <sup>(10)</sup>Because the time which is gone can’t come back and neither do our childhood. It is a time which many poets and writer praises in their creations.
	 In <sup>(11)</sup>childhood, one should need to enjoy his/her life without any worry. It is a time in which one should have to take care of his diet, his health, and immunity. <sup>(12)</sup>Besides, the children should be taught to be neat and clean, to eat, read, sleep, play, and to do exercise regularly and these things should be in the habits <sup>(13)</sup>of the child.
	 Moreover, we should try to influence children to start productive habits such as reading, writing that should help them in later life. But the <sup>(14)</sup>books they read and what they write should be carefully checked by the parents.t is the best time of life because the memories that we make in our <sup>(15)</sup>childhood always brings a smile on our face. 
	Also, it is the time when the character of the child is shaped. Besides, it also is the best time to understand <sup>(16)</sup>life and gain knowledge. Everyone has a few memories from their childhood that seem so vividly true that we cling onto them and believe that every <sup>(17)</sup>single little detail of this memory is completely true. What if someone told 
	you that parts of this memory could be entirely false, even the whole <sup>(18)</sup>memory could be fabricated? How do you determine if this memory is actual something that you went through, or if it was a story that you fabricated a <sup>(19)</sup>“movie” for in your head? I have two memories from my childhood that may or may not even have happened, the only way to 
	find out is to analyze them. <sup>(20)</sup>To start off, the first memory I could recall from my childhood would be.</blockquote></p>

    <h2 id="teen">Teenage Years:</h2>
	<a href="teen.jpg"><img src="teen.jpg" alt="This is my teen picture." width="150px"/></a>
	<p><blockquote><sup>(1)</sup>During my teenage years or my high school, it is when the time I went to explore some things that gives me curiosity. While Im in high school I met new <sup>(2)</sup>friends and until now I hangout with sometimes, back then we often drink some liqour to have some fun, cutting classes to play some computer games or <sup>(3)</sup>to stroll around our town.
	Our class was one of the teacher's enemy class (haha), maybe because of my crazy classmates or the teachers just hate us either <sup>(4)</sup>way some of the teachers love our section due to jolliness of my classmates. The teenage years are the best years of one's life'. 
	Time and tide waits for no <sup>(5)</sup>man. Although this saying may seem incredibly cliched, this proves to be the most truthful statement of all. Man are often engaged in the never ending <sup>(6)</sup>chase for time. Many have wasted their youth away during their teenage years and only to regret after it has been a forgone conclusion. i agree that the <sup>(7)</sup>teenage years are the best years of one's life.
	Tennagers are generally full of vitality and energy. This advantage allows them to conquer the world literally, <sup>(8)</sup>experience new insights, gain wisdom and acquire knowledge. Teenagers can also challenge themselves to practise extreme physical sports like mountain <sup>(9)</sup>climbing. Often free from financial burdens, nothing…show more content…
	When you're a teenager, you get blamed for anything wrong you do, get <sup>(10)</sup>grounded, punished, unlike before when you were a child, and you could get away with murder, and nobody could do anything about it! You can say <sup>(11)</sup>goodbye to those days now!
	It's all not so bad about being a teenager though. Now you don't have to have your parents take you to somewhere you want <sup>(12)</sup>to go, and somewhere you couldn't go before. You can go with friends and have fun, which you couldn't because all of you were too little to know what <sup>(13)</sup>fun is! You can now go to amusement parks, parties etc. with friends, or even alone. 
	It's a very enjoyable time of life, if you do the right stuff, and put <sup>(14)</sup>thought into what you are doing. But with all good things, must come the bad. During this age, you are old and hopefully smart enough to understand <sup>(15)</sup>what is good for you, and make decisions without consulting others. But with that comes risk, and nowadays, fun stuff are usually bad stuff.
	With the <sup>(16)</sup>society turning for the bad as days pass, the teens are getting into all sorts of trouble with drugs and alcohol. Teenage years are depressing because they <sup>(17)</sup>are going through some of the biggest changes in their life. Teens start high school and have to deal with being little in a school again. They go through <sup>(18)</sup>major hormonal changes. Their bodies develop and grow. 
	They have to decide whether or not they are going to college or not. Teenage life tends to <sup>(19)</sup>revolve around school and relationships. There are the kids who can balance their grades and social life; there are the kids who only care about their <sup>(20)</sup>relationships, there are the kids who only care about their grades.

    <h2 id="college">College Years:</h2>
	<a href="college.jpg"><img src="college.jpg" alt="This is my college picture." width="150px"/></a>
	<p><blockquote><sup>(1)</sup>College life is known as one of the most memorable years of one’s life. It is entirely different from school life. College life exposes us to new experiences <sup>(2)</sup>and things that we were not familiar with earlier. For some people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. While for others, it is <sup>(3)</sup>time to get serious about their career and study thoroughly 
	for a brighter future. Nonetheless, college life remains a memorable time for all of us. Not <sup>(4)</sup>everyone is lucky enough to experience college life. People do not get the chance to go to college due to various reasons. Sometimes they do not have a <sup>(5)</sup>strong financial background to do so while other times they have other responsibilities to fulfill. The ones who have had a college life 
	always wish to turn <sup>(6)</sup>back time to live it all once again. College life is a big transition from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. Our schools were a <sup>(7)</sup>safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. The transition to college is so sudden that you’re no longer protected by your teachers and <sup>(8)</sup>friends of your school time.
    College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. You are now in a place full of unfamiliar faces where you need to mingle <sup>(9)</sup>in. It teaches us to socialize and form opinions of our own. In college, students learn their free will and they go on to become more confident and 
	<sup>(10)</sup>composed. In school life, we were always dependant on our friends or teachers. College life teaches us to be independent. It makes us stronger and <sup>(11)</sup>teaches us to fight our own battles. It also makes us serious about our careers. We make decisions that will affect our future all by ourselves, as in school <sup>(12)</sup>life our parents did it for us.
	Additionally, in schools, we viewed our teachers as our mentors and sometimes even parents. We respected them and kept a <sup>(13)</sup>distance. However, in college life, the teacher-student relationship becomes a bit informal. They become more or less like our friends and we share our <sup>(14)</sup>troubles and happiness with them as we did with our friends. 
	Life in college is quite interesting because there are so many interesting things in college. I <sup>(15)</sup>found that there would be more free time to do the things I like, study whatever major I like and possibly find a part-time job and make money to buy <sup>(16)</sup>something that I had never be able to afford back into my high school life. Even though college seems like a paradise for me, 
	it is still a place for me to <sup>(17)</sup>make academic progress and to pursue becoming a successful college student. In addition, without my parents’ guardianship, I need to be more <sup>(18)</sup>responsible for myself. In order to be a successful student in college, I need to have self-discipline, thoughtfulness, and thriftiness. 
	College life is a <sup>(19)</sup>person’s golden period of early youth. He remembers it in his whole life. He can never forget it. The pericd of college life may be two years of <sup>(20)</sup>intermediate classes. It may include two more years of graduation. College life is a life of freedom. There is no fear of teachers. The teachers behave in a <sup>(21)</sup>friendly manner. The students feel no compulsion in studies. 
	They develop a sense of duty and study.</blockquote></p>
